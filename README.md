Development of this project differs much from the standard e-commerce webside development approach as flexible and highly customizable platform was one of the core requirements. We took it seriously developing own admin panel (or CMS, content management system) that took that variability of scenarios of use of the website to the completely different level.

The developed design system was matched with company's style and brandbook to create a serious and modern picture.

The core function of the landing page is to describe what **MonFi** is all about and show the potential client all the opportunities they will have if they start using the company's products.

This landing takes the approach of being **simple** yet **super informative** using modern design trends such as background gradients and patterns.

Main action the user is expected to engage in is Login/Register buttons in the website header that, by clicking on them, navigate the user to the crowdfunding platform.

#### Crowdfunding platform

It achieves its goal through **investment boxes**. Investment boxes differ by price and duration. The longer the box takes to complete - the greater the income is. This proportion creates great possibilities for possible investors and creates an opportunity for MonFi team to develop the platform using the given resources.

The platform supports payment with many crypto tokens and coins, including `USDT TRC20`, `USDT ERC20`, `BTC` and `ETH`. The payment is also achievable via `SEPA` money transfer.

The platform involves many interesting concepts. For example, investment packages can have many payouts. The app also has multi-level referral program that allows for better platform marketing.

#### Token and ICO

An interesting part of crowdfunding strategy of MonFi is Monfi token. 

The token itself operates on the `ETH` chain that gives great opportunities for investments as this chain is the most popular among the other chains.

The ICO is implemented via token presale smart contract and page on investment platform:

##### Presale smart contract 

Manages how the tokens can be purchased. It is called from the web UI using MetaMask or different MetaMask API compatible ETH web3 provider
