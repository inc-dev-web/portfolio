Development of this project differs much from the standard e-commerce webside development approach as flexible and highly customizable platform was one of the core requirements. We took it seriously developing own admin panel (or CMS, content management system) that took that variability of scenarios of use of the website to the completely different level.

The developed design system was matched with company's style and brandbook to create a serious and modern picture.

The design system alongside with rapid-working UI creates a beautiful image that makes client's first impression unforgettable and generates income for the website owners.
